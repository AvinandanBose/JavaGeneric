This is all about Java Generics

<h3> Java includes support for writing generic classes and methods that can operate on variety of data types while often avoiding the need for explicit casts. The generics framework allow us to define a class in terms of a set of <em><i>formal type parameters</i></em>, which can then be used as the declared type for variables , parameters, and return values within the class definition. Those formal type parameters are later specified when using the generic class as a type elsewhere in a program. Generics are a feature of Java that allows us to create classes and methods that work with different types of data.Generics are a way to make our code more flexible and reusable.</h3>
